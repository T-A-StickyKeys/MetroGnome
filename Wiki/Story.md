# Story

## Goal

Our story should be presented in a way that suits the video game medium.

We are attempting to make a 'small' project, so we don't need a magnum opus, just a functional story.

## Inspirations

We're building the game's aesthetic and story from these elements:
- Zelda - In General & gameplay wise: Link to the Past and Oracle of Seasons.
- Little Gnome dude - on a whim.
- Music-y Stuff - as a prototype for A's sound system.
- T's "In the Time of Giants" ancient notebook scribbles.
- Connecting temples/towns with trains for milestones and unlocking fast travel - on a whim.

These ideas were conjured in our first brainstorm and landed us on MetroGnome.

## Theme: "On the Shoulders of Giants"

A story about being a small person having to learn and live up to all the great people that have come before.
Focusing on both Art (the music side of the story) and Technology (trains & giants stuff)

Sub-Theme 1 (More external / plot): Technology, connecting the trains, connecting groups of people, communication

Sub-Theme 2 (more internal / Story): Emotion, balance, expression and understand, relationship connections

## Story Structure and Style

I recommend a thematic episodic approach to the story. There will be major plot points, but the meat of the story telling will be done in smaller sub-stories that all revolve around the theme. This is very much in keeping with zelda, and rpg's in general, often times the side-quests are the best part. Our protagonist will be silent, go on a pretty standard quest, and along the way meet different characters and challenges that each revolve around the central theme and conflict.

## Plot

### Structure
For this project, I'm going to make a variant of the 7 Point and Hero's Journey Structures.

Act I
  1. Ordinary World
  2. Turn 1 - Call to Adventure

  Plot-wise establish:
    - Problem
    - Stakes
    - Time Frame

  Theme-wise establish:
    - The concept: An open-ended thesis statement
    - The possible ways it could go

Act II
3. Pinch 1 - Fun/expected Trials
    - The first big chunk of gameplay and challenges.
    - Plot: general adventure starting progress
    - Theme: establish the core Arguments.
4. Midpoint - Taking Action
    - Our player has a chance to take action of their own accord / Strike a pivotal blow.
    - Plot: Big plot point that is resolved with a major turn in the direction of the story.  The goal changes.
    - Theme: Player/MC gets to 'state their argument' against the problem. But they are met with a devastating counter.
5. Pinch 2 - Dire Trials
    - The second big chunk of gameplay and challenges.
    - Plot: adventure progress, but things are getting serious and grim.
    - Theme: develop counterarguments.

Act III
6. Turn 2 - Climax
    - The Last chunk of gameplay.
    - Plot: Finishing up adventure progress
    - Theme: Synthesis of thematic arguments
6-b. Final Ordeal
    - Plot/Gameplay: final boss and level
    - Theme: The thematic arguments Conclusion statement.
7. Resolution
    - The Player/Hero/MC returns home changed.
    - Plot: yay the game is over, let's wrap up.
    - Theme: Woo hoo the day is saved.

### Gameplay Implementation

1. ???Beginning Town
2. Call to adventure
3. First 30-40% of Levels
4. Midgame dungeon or boss, some story event that interrupts the core flow.
5. Second 30-40% of levels
6. Final set of side quests, final dungeon, final boss.
7. Go back home, see the positive change you've had on the world.
