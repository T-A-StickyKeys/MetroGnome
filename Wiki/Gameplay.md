# Gameplay

The game will be a top down 2.5-Dimension square tiled game ala 2d Zelda's like oracle of seasons and Link to the past.

## Movement

The player will be able to move in using 4 directions. 
TODO:
Controls: Cardinal only? 8 way? Omni?
Speed and Positioning: continuous? discrete tile by tile?


## Maps

The maps will be in square tiles, and will allow for multi-level hieghts. Their potentially will be ledges that seperate sections of the map ass different hieghts. As well as holes and ladders that seperate maps as existing above and below one another.

## Core mechanics

### Thoughts:
We are demphasizing straight forward combat, and shifting to a more eviroment puzzle and puzzle combat style of gameplay. We are also attempting to add depth to the player's abilities by making each thing multi capable in both exploration and combat. We also want to focus on zelda esc items that help unlock a little bit of metroidvania esc exploration. There is also the Music and sound themeing in our game. We have decided on creating a system around the ideas of the Push-hand and the Play-hand.

### The System:
There for we are focusing on a Specialized Item based system that is implemented through the modifiers of Push and Play.

### Push Hand:
The push hand can grab onto things and push them in the direction of the player's movement blocks and push them.

Exploration example: push blocks for a sliding block puzzle.
Combat example: an enemy may be dangerous on one side. The push hand and grab them from their inert side and the player could then move them off a ledge, or in some other way use or disable them.

The push hand can be extended and upgraded to pull, rotate, and carry.

The push hand presents a very simple interaction with a phsycal world that can by made deep through various options and choices made.

### Play Hand:
The play hand is focus on music and manipulation. It activates whatever Item is currently equiped. 

TODO: We've talked about this a bunch, but I think we may have over done it because I can't clearly state our intentions here.




## Play Matrix

This is a table of game options the player has, vs the option that the computer has.

It is in the style of a game theory matrix, but is not formal, and would be changed bases on point in the game, and the challenges being presented.
