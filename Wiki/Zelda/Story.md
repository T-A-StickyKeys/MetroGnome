# Story

### Tentative Name
## Legend of Link: Timeless Tides

Taking place in between Ocarine of Time and Wind Waker, this is the story of the Kingdom of Hyrule falling to Gannondorf resulting in the need to seal him beneath the great flood.

Gannondorf's demon army is on Hyrule's doorstep. The kind is rushing to manage the situation. Zelda wants to help but her position as princess has her bound to the castle. She disguises herself by crossdressing as a young man and sneaks out to adventure across the lands, looking for new and powerfull magics that might give them the edge.

Ultimately, she fails.
