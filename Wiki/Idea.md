## Messages from Discord for me to go back and look at.

### A

Alright, I've been thinking about it, I think one of the emotions we focus on needs to be depression as the extreme, sadness as acceptable. The reason it is acceptable is because you can't understand happiness with experiencing at least a little sadness. Possibly a bit of being happy all the time is exhausting by having a happy person in the village where their side quest shows that they needed a bit of sadness as their break. Maybe they accept a death of a family member or something. Maybe you get and instrument for them and play a sad song on it. That could be how you get your first instrument. I think this could tie into the main heroes story if we do it as the first town as well. It becomes the call for the rest of the story because the hero learns that you need to make your life what you want it to be. Make your own happiness in a sense. This was a bit of a word vomit, but what are your thoughts? Music for the town will be jazz akin to the streets of Mombasa from halo 3 ODST. https://youtu.be/MzJjzEEphfM. And innocent soul by spyro gyra https://youtu.be/Sbr2TiX2C8s. Both of these are saxophone heavy, so maybe your first instrument is a sax?

I like the idea of an overly relaxed seaside town as well, with Carribean-esque music, where they relax a bit too much. I don't that one fully thought out yet, and I'm a little nervous about calling lazy people out a bit with that one, but I don't think we need to worry about that too much. I pass the thoughts about that to you. Maybe town 2 or 3.
Also, feel free to rearrange these as you see fit, I'm just brainstorming a bit.
I think a funny quest with the relaxed people would be getting a dude a banana that's literally either 1 tile away, or just of screen. That's it, that's the whole sidequest.
The dungeon would possibly be a bit more empty enemy wise and just have more challenging puzzles to make up for it

The first item you get should be a Metronome, or rather it teaches you rhythm, and then you can use your hands from there.

maybe the metronome becomes a UI gauge that tells you the beat (if that becomes a mechanic).

When I was making dreamline I originally had an emotion based magic system. I can't find the original with the advanced info, but here is a recreation of the cardinals and secondaries:

Here is a Suggestion for our core Emotions:

I like this construction because it lacks Happiness. Sort of a Stoic or Buddhist idea, Pain is garunteed, happiness is a temporay gift you should be grateful for, but its not a core to the expirience.

More over, with our Artistic musical expression theme: music that expresses "I'm happy, my life is good" is almost always vapid. Things like Love, Hope, or Celebration all have more bite because they all imply some lurking problem. Love -> Heartbreak, Celebration -> had to work for it, Hope -> you wouldn't need it without something working against you.

Obsession (Bad) -> Passion -> Enrichment (Good) as the center
And then, maybe People should move from each town! Each town should have some people that travel to the other towns as part of the side quests, to explore the mixtures and balancing of multiple.
Maybe the center temple has an abandoned town -> recruit people (Your zelda sages) through side quests to build it back up, and they can help us explore Passion. (Main quest will still hold the focus on that tho)

Alright. Here is the chart.

Some of the nuanced cross emotions might be take a lot to explain over text, but next time we can chat I could probably explain in lie 10 minutes.

Starting Town and Temples:

I don't know if our guys should start at a temple town or go there.
If we do the ruined city at the final temple, maybe they come from a village of the remnants that moved away? They gives villain a closer connection to it.

Starting Village -> get rhythm
Journey on foot to closest temple town -> Level 1
Town 1 -> Characters, story, and Side quests
Temple 1-1 : Level 2
Unlock train and Item
6 & 7. Repeat 3 & 4 for temple town 2
Go to center -> Midgame challenge level
9, 10, 11, & 12. Repeat 3 & 4 for temple town 3 & 4
got to center -> story development, midgame boss?
Go where ever you want -> side quests round 2
Temple 1-2, 2-2, 3-2, 4-2 -> item upgrades?
"Hey listen! Something bad is happing at final temple! Get Prepared!"
Go where ever, final side quests, (Explore hidden areas of temple -> one last puzzle and a mini-boss)
Final level
Final Boss.
Go around and talk to people, see results, go back home, roll credits.

That's a total of 11-ish level and 2 good bosses. That's a very manageable amount of level development.

Side Quest and Story wise we'll probably need to condense and streamline, but there's no reason we can't do everything we've talked about so far.
